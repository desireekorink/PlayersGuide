/*
The town of Freach recently had an awful looping disaster.
The lead investigator found that it was a faulty ++ operator in an old for loop,
but the town council has chosen to ban all loops but the foreach loop.
Yet Freach uses the code presented earlier in this level to compute the minimum and the average value in an int array.
They have hired you to rework their existing for-based code to use foreach loops instead.

Objectives:

Start with the code for computing an arrayâ€™s minimum and average values in the section Some Examples with Arrays (see below)
int[] array = { 4, 51, -7, 13, -99, 15, -8, 45, 90 };
int currentSmallest = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Start higher than anything in the array.
for (int index = 0; index < array.length; index++)
{
    if (array[index] < currentSmallest)
        currentSmallest = array[index];
}
System.out.println(currentSmallest);

int total = 0;
for (int index = 0; index < array.length; index++)
    total += array[index];
double average = (double)total / array.length;
System.out.println(average);
Modify the code to use foreach loops instead of for loops
